# health-reloader

health-reloader is a small health monitoring utility which can be used to add 
healthchecking features to legacy applications like bind.

## Example

Add the following line to your bind config:
```
foo.bar  A        192.168.0.1 ; HealthCheck{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 9000, "path": "minio/health/live", "proto": "https", "insecureSkipVerify": true}
```

Run health-reloader:
```
./health-reloader -input /etc/bind/foo.tpl -output /etc/bind/foo -replace-with-timestamp 1970010101 -header '; Autogenerated DO NOT EDIT' -command 'service reload bind9'
```
